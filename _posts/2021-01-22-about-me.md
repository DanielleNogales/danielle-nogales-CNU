# Danielle Nogales' About Me

![Profile Picture](https://DanielleNogales.github.io/danielle-nogales-CNU/images/Profilepicture.jpg)

Hello everyone! My name is Danielle, but I go by Dani. I am a sophomore at CNU majoring in English with a concentration in writing. I am also minoring in Leadership Studies and psychology. I am interested in Digital Humanities because it allows for further investigation within the technological world. 

For my future goals, I hope to become a _writer_. Writing has been a passion of mine for a while now. A project that I am currently working on is writing an anthology for my collection of poems. As of right now, I am a part of the **Instagram** poetry and writing community. This platform has not only given me a space to share my work, but has also made me connect with artists from all over the world.

Aside from writing, I also volunteer for an organization called **Families in Transition**. At this site, the students tutor kids in numerous subjects in a safe and welcoming environment. I have many funny stories of the children there. Another organization I am a part of is the **Latino Student Association**. This club has given me a chance to connect with my heritage since I am half Bolivian on my fatherâ€™s side. I love being a part of a community where people can celebrate and learn more about different cultures! Lastly, I belong to an a cappella group called **The Newport Pearls**. We sing at events such as _Glow in the Darcapella_ which is always a crowd favorite.

I have lived in Virginia my whole life. I come from a small town where there is not a lot to do on the weekends. Thankfully, I live about 40 minutes from D.C. so I usually hang around there and go peruse the exquisite museums. Besides this, I have two siblings and a dog named Oscar. A fun fact is that I named him after the main protagonist in _Shark Tale_. He is a feisty Pomeranian who is not too fond of myself. Although this is the case, I still love him. In my spare time, I love hosting open mic nights via Instagram Live. I feel like this event really pushes artists out of their comfort zone for it allows them a space where they can open up about their personal experiences through poetry.

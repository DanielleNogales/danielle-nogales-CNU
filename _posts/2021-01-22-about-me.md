Hello everyone! My name is Danielle, but I go by Dani. I am a sophomore at CNU majoring in English with a concentration in writing. I am also minoring in Leadership Studies and psychology. I am interested in Digital Humanities because it allows for further investigation within the technological world. 

# Future Projects
For my future goals, I hope to become a writer. A project that I am currently working on is writing an anthology for my collection of poems. As of right now, I am a part of the Instagram poetry and writing community. This platform has not only given me a space to share my work, but has also made me connect with artists from all over the world.

# Involvements
Aside from writing, I also volunteer for an organization called **Families in Transition**. At this site, the students tutor kids in numerous subjects in a safe and welcoming environment. I have many funny stories of the children there. Another organization I am a part of is the Latino Student Association. This club has given me a chance to connect with my heritage since I am half Bolivian on my fatherâ€™s side. Lastly I belong to an a cappella group called The Newport Pearls. We sing at events such as Glow in the Darcapella which is always a crowd favorite.

# Personal Life
I have lived in Virginia my whole life. I come from a small town where there is not a lot to do on the weekends. Thankfully, I live about 40 minutes from D.C. so I usually hang around there and go peruse the exquisite museums. Besides this, I have two siblings and a dog named Oscar. A fun fact is that I named him after the protagonist in _Shark Tale_. He is a feisty Pomeranian who is not too fond of myself. Although this is the case, I still love him.

My name is Danielle, but I go by Dani. I am a sophomore at CNU majoring in English with a concentration in writing. I am also minoring in Leadership Studies and psychology. I am interested in Digital Humanities because it allows for further investigation within the technological world. 

For my future goals, I hope to become a writer. A project that I am currently working on is writing an anthology for my collection of poems. As of right now, I am a part of the Instagram poetry and writing community. This platform has not only given me a space to share my work, but has also made me connect with artists from all over the world.

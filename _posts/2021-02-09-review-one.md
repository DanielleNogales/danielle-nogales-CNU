# Summary

The Pulter Project is a collaborative effort that allows readers to read and analyze hundreds of poems by Hester Pulter. The project aims to get rid of one editorial process of each poem. Instead there are many versions of the same poem in order to break down Pulterâ€™s poetics as a means of understanding each work.

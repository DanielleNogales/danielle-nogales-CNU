# Summary

The Pulter Project is a collaborative effort that allows readers to read and analyze hundreds of poems by Hester Pulter. The project aims to get rid of one editorial process of each poem. Instead there are many versions of the same poem in order to break down Pulter’s poetics as a means of understanding each work.

By constructing this frame, editors have in a sense pulled back on having one complete version of each poem. They want readers to see the complexities that go on within writers’ minds in order to create a poem. 

# Design

The level of organization is very consistent throughout the project. When the reader first discovers the site, there are three buttons on the main screen that they can navigate. These three are the preface, the poems, and the discoveries. This efficiency allows the reader to search and explore without getting lost. 

There are two ways that readers can engage with the poems: a comparison tool that allows for analyzing the vast editions, facsimiles, and transcriptions of the manuscript and a reading tool for looking at a single edition along with additional notes provided for each poem. 

# Comparison Tools

All 120 of Hester Pulter poems are listed in alphabetical order according to author surname and periodically by writers who have responded to her work. This element is well organized for readers to click on what items are most recent as well as most relevant. In addition, themes are provided under the poems which can be helpful in determining the interests of the reader. The poems contain an elemental and amplified version of the work along with providing notes about the historical context. 

While the comparison tool is an efficient effort to provide variety, there seems to be little to no difference when comparing the versions. In order for the reader to get a glimpse of how the versions are different, they should update the amplified version and transform it into more modernized language. That way they can really compare the 17th century writing to the present day version.

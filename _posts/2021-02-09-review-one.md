# Summary

The _Pulter Project_ is a collaborative effort that allows readers to read and analyze hundreds of poems by Hester Pulter. The project aims to get rid of one editorial process of each poem. Instead there are many versions of the same poem in order to break down Pulter’s poetics as a means of understanding each work.

By constructing this frame, editors have in a sense pulled back on having one complete version of each poem. They want readers to see the complexities that go on within writers’ minds in order to create a poem. 

# Design

The level of organization is very consistent throughout the project. When the reader first discovers the site, there are three buttons on the main screen that they can navigate. These three are the preface, the poems, and the discoveries. This efficiency allows the reader to search and explore without getting lost. 

There are two ways that readers can engage with the poems: a comparison tool that allows for analyzing the vast editions, facsimiles, and transcriptions of the manuscript and a reading tool for looking at a single edition along with additional notes provided for each poem. 

# Comparison Tools

All 120 of Hester Pulter poems are listed in alphabetical order according to author surname and periodically by writers who have responded to her work. This element is well organized for readers to click on what items are most recent as well as most relevant. In addition, themes are provided under the poems which can be helpful in determining the interests of the reader. The poems contain an elemental and amplified version of the work along with providing notes about the historical context. 

While the comparison tool is an efficient effort to provide variety, there seems to be little to no difference when comparing the versions. In order for the reader to get a glimpse of how the versions are different, they should update the amplified version and transform it into more modernized language. That way they can really compare the 17th century writing to the present day version.

# Digital Humanities

On the main screen, the reader will see a link for a video. Once they click on the icon, the video will show some of the visual elements contained within the project. While it’s fascinating to glimpse at the introductory video, it fails to give the viewer insight on what the _Pulter Project_ is about. It could benefit from detailing why they made the project as well. This way the reader can choose to watch or read the project’s description. 

Another key feature of the project is the original manuscript from Pulter’s handwriting. This document is very interesting in the sense that the reader can feel closely connected to the text. Although the handwriting was difficult to view even when using the magnifying glass button. Perhaps if the poem was directly beside the manuscript then the reader would be able to follow along more easily. In addition, maybe they can enlarge the text so the font is not strenuous to read.

# Relevance

In all, this project does an efficient job in utilizing many aspects of technology in order to explore the realms of Pulter’s poems. The reader is able to gain more knowledge on how poets create masterpieces by looking at the different interpretations of each work. The technology serves as a compare and contrast element as well as show how different meanings can be formed based on who reads the text. In all, the project does a great job at capturing how there is not one ideal definition of poetry, but rather many.

# Summary

The Pulter Project is a collaborative effort that allows readers to read and analyze hundreds of poems by Hester Pulter. The project aims to get rid of one editorial process of each poem. Instead there are many versions of the same poem in order to break down Pulter’s poetics as a means of understanding each work.

By constructing this frame, editors have in a sense pulled back on having one complete version of each poem. They want readers to see the complexities that go on within writers’ minds in order to create a poem.

# Summary

The Pulter Project is a collaborative effort that allows readers to read and analyze hundreds of poems by Hester Pulter. The project aims to get rid of one editorial process of each poem. Instead there are many versions of the same poem in order to break down Pulter’s poetics as a means of understanding each work.

By constructing this frame, editors have in a sense pulled back on having one complete version of each poem. They want readers to see the complexities that go on within writers’ minds in order to create a poem. 

# Design

The level of organization is very consistent throughout the project. When the reader first discovers the site, there are three buttons on the main screen that they can navigate. These three are the preface, the poems, and the discoveries. This efficiency allows the reader to search and explore without getting lost. 

There are two ways that readers can engage with the poems: a comparison tool that allows for analyzing the vast editions, facsimiles, and transcriptions of the manuscript and a reading tool for looking at a single edition along with additional notes provided for each poem.

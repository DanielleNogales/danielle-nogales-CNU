#### Summary

_The Lost Museum_ is an interactive digital humanities project exploring the museum of P.T. Barnum’s American Museum that dives deep into exploring topics covered in a U.S. History class. Many of these topics include the Civil War Era that delves into the heart of issues regarding race, gender, reform, immigration, sectionalism, and popular culture. 



The reader is able to explore the 3-D environment museum and solve the mystery on who burned the American Museum down. Some of the activities include reading overviews on artifacts as well as finding clues in order to track potential suspects. From 1996-2002, this project was a collaborative process incorporating many historians, artists, programmers, writers, researchers, and animators ranging in a variety of backgrounds. 

#### Design 

When you first enter the site, a video pops up on the center screen explaining the aftermath of _The Lost Museum_. The video is very informative for the reader may not have any previous knowledge of what happened. However, I feel that towards the end of the video, the sound becomes screechy once the narrator is done talking. The last 30 seconds are not necessary for there is no context provided in general. 

From there the user has numerous options such as exploring the museum, solving the mystery, searching the archives, and visiting the classroom. If they choose to go inside the museum, they first need to create an account asking for their email address in order to access it. Although it wasn’t difficult creating the account, I feel that some people may not feel comfortable providing their information to create one. While in the museum, one can search for hotspots in order to learn more about various topics. The “show hotspots” button was very helpful, but they appear and disappear in a matter of seconds. It might have been easier for them to show the icons and tap them rather than have them appear for a very short duration. 

The next section they can click on is the archives which can guide them to different documents as well as exhibits. This is very useful for if someone can not find them within the 3-D museum, they can easily access the information using this option. Lastly, the classroom tool provides lessons instructors can use in order to teach the lesson. While this function provides great ideas for learning, it shouldn’t be heavily relied on for the artifacts within the museum merely give a description about history.

#### Digital Humanities

This project does a great job combining both history and technology in order to get the user engaged as well as learn numerous topics. By creating a 3-D museum, people can explore in a visual and exciting way. I believe this project makes an efficient learning experience for anyone because of the interactive elements such as finding artifacts and solving the mystery of the fire that killed the American Museum. 

#### Conclusion

Overall, The Lost Museum is a beautifully crafted project for it made learning about history interesting and fun. Learning about certain topics can be repetitive and I feel that this site opens the doors to an effective method of attaining knowledge on the Civil War era.
